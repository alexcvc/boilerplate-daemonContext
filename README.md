# Another C++ daemon boilerplate

## Abstract

This contains another C++ daemon boilerplate  implementation

This contains another C++ daemon boilerplate  implementation. 
A focus of this implementation the embedded Linux applications.

There are several optional features such as foreground execution and a test console. 
The C++ compiler must support at least C++11, a C++20 compiler is preferred for future enhancements. 

In the TODO plan there are followings:
 
1) Examples of using and extending this boilerplate for a real application with a separate implementation of an independent application context;
2) secure use in multithreaded applications;
3) application restart without stop and start daemon. 
4) examples an abstract context application for IEC61850, IE60870-5-10X protocol converter;
5) examples of how to use these code in IoT applications with Raspberry and BeagleBoard.

You can use and modify these sources in your application as needed and desired.
Hope you enjoy!
